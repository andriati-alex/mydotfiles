# Frequently used programs configuration

This repository aims to store come simple configuration files for (in my opinion) the
most useful programs I use. In this way, I avoid losing time when, for some reason, I
need a fresh install of my system.

I intent to maintain as a open repository, but not to be a well documented one as it
is used for a very particular purpose.
